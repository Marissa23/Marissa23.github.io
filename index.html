	<h3> Volleyball is a Game Made Up of Mistakes! </h3>
		<p> There are different ways to touch a volleyball, and different things necessary to be doing even when you're not touching the volleyball. Even if you're not passing, setting, or hitting in that specific play, you should still be covering your teammates, watching the other team's movements, and following the ball, regardless of what side of the court it's on. These are some of the specifics that most people don't realize go into playing the sport of volleyball. <a href="http://www.volleyball.org/general/">This page</a> should help with any general questions or understanding! </p>
